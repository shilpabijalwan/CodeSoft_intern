            Homi Jehangir Bhabha, was an Indian nuclear physicist who is widely
            credited as the <span>father of the Indian nuclear programme</span>.
            He was the founding director and professor of physics at the Tata
            Institute of Fundamental Research (TIFR), as well as the founding

            The timeline of Homi Jehangir Bhabha's life:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              1909: Homi Jehangir Bhabha was born on October 30, 1909, in
              Bombay, British India (now Mumbai, India) into a wealthy Parsi
              family.
            </li>
            <li>
              1927-1930: Bhabha studied mechanical engineering at the Royal
              Institute of Science in Bombay (now the Indian Institute of
              Science) and later pursued higher studies in Cambridge, England.
            </li>
            <li>
              1930: He entered Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge, to study
              mechanical engineering.
            </li>
            <li>
              1933: Completed his studies in mechanical engineering and then
              pursued theoretical studies in physics under Nobel laureate Paul
              Dirac at Cambridge University.
            </li>
            <li>
              1935: Bhabha earned his doctorate in nuclear physics from the
              University of Cambridge with a thesis titled "The Absorption of
              Cosmic radiation."
            </li>
            <li>
              1939: With the outbreak of World War II, Bhabha couldn't return to
              India and continued his research work in England. He contributed
              significantly to the field of cosmic rays and quantum theory
              during this period.
            </li>
            <li>
              1940: Published a groundbreaking paper on the theory of
              electron-positron scattering, which is now known as Bhabha
              scattering.
            </li>
            <li>
              1944: Bhabha returned to India and played a pivotal role in the
              development of scientific research in the country. He advocated
              for the establishment of nuclear research facilities in India.
            </li>

            </li>
            <li>
              1954: Bhabha represented India in the First United Nations
              Conference on the Peaceful Uses of Atomic Energy and advocated for
              the use of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes.
            </li>
            <li>
              1960: Tragically, Homi Jehangir Bhabha died in an air crash on
              January 24, 1966. The Air India Flight 101, a Boeing 707, crashed
              near Mont Blanc in France, and Bhabha lost his life in the
              accident. His death was a significant loss to India's scientific
              community.
